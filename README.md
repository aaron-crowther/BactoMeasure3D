# BactoMeasure3D
A high-throughput 3D image-analysis pipeline combining FIJI, ilastik, and R to segment bacteria from fluorescence microscopy images and compute morphological features (e.g., cell length). Optimised for batch processing, reproducible analysis, and adaptable to diverse bacterial shapes.
